# Kakuna Ipsum Generator

A **'hard' coded Lorem Ipsum Generator** that generates paragraphs with the famous _KAKUNA used HARDEN!_.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   - `git clone https://github.com/joaopalmeiro/Kakuna-Ipsum-Generator.git YOUR_FOLDER_NAME`
2. Change directory:
   - `cd YOUR_FOLDER_NAME`
3. Install NPM dependencies:
   - `npm install`
4. Run one of the task runners (if necessary, install [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) first):
   - `gulp` manually compiles files.
   - `gulp watch` automatically compiles files and applies changes using [BrowserSync](https://browsersync.io/) when you make changes to the source files.
